# Your AI Agents Are Talking. Are You Listening to the Security Risks?

*A breakdown of the new OWASP guide on why teams of autonomous AI agents represent the next frontier of security threats.*

We stand at the dawn of a new technological paradigm: the age of agentic AI. We're moving beyond single, monolithic AI models to build dynamic, multi-agent systems (MAS). Imagine a team of specialized AI agents collaborating on complex tasks—one handling sales outreach, another qualifying leads, and a third personalizing marketing content, all in perfect, autonomous synchrony.

This is the promise of MAS: unparalleled efficiency and automation. But as these autonomous agents begin to communicate, coordinate, and act on our behalf, they also create a new, intricate, and poorly understood attack surface.

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), the non-profit foundation for improving software security, has turned its attention to this emerging challenge. Their new [Multi-Agentic System Threat Modelling Guide](https://genai.owasp.org/resource/multi-agentic-system-threat-modeling-guide-v1-0/) provides a crucial framework for navigating this new territory. It's a must-read for any developer, security professional, or leader building with agentic AI.

Here's a breakdown of the key takeaways.

## The Problem: More Agents, More Problems

A single AI agent has its own set of vulnerabilities, which OWASP has covered in its Top 10 for LLM Applications. But when you connect multiple agents, the risks don't just add up; they multiply and transform.

Multi-agent systems introduce several new security complexities:

**Expanded Attack Surface**: Every agent, every connection, and every shared resource is a potential entry point.

**Emergent Behavior**: The complex interactions between agents can lead to unforeseen and insecure system behaviors that weren't explicitly programmed.

**Cascading Failures**: A single compromised agent can act as a "super-spreader," poisoning other agents, corrupting shared data, and potentially bringing down the entire system.

**Loss of Traceability**: When dozens of agents collaborate on a decision, tracing a malicious action back to its source can become a forensic nightmare.

Traditional security models weren't designed for this level of autonomy and complexity. We need a new way to think about these threats.

## Introducing MAESTRO: A Framework for Agentic AI Security

To address this, the guide introduces MAESTRO (Multi-Agent Environment, Security, Threat, Risk, and Outcome), a framework for threat modeling in agentic AI systems.

MAESTRO breaks down a multi-agent system into seven distinct layers, allowing teams to systematically analyze potential vulnerabilities at each level of the architecture.

Here are the layers and the kinds of questions they prompt:

**Foundation Models**: How secure and aligned are the core LLMs powering the agents? Could they be manipulated or made to hallucinate?

**Data Operations**: How is data being retrieved and managed? Could an agent's knowledge base (like a vector database) be poisoned with malicious information?

**Agent Frameworks**: How is the agent's logic and workflow controlled? Can an attacker hijack its decision-making process or make it misuse its tools?

**Deployment Infrastructure**: Where is the agent running? Are the containers, networks, and cloud services secure?

**Evaluation and Observability**: How are you monitoring your agents? Can an attacker manipulate logs to cover their tracks or overwhelm human reviewers?

**Security & Compliance**: What are the rules of the road? How are access controls and policies enforced across this distributed system?

**Agent Ecosystem**: How do agents interact with each other, with humans, and with external tools? Can one agent spoof the identity of another? Could a rogue agent be introduced into the ecosystem?

By examining each layer, MAESTRO provides a comprehensive map of the agentic attack surface, moving beyond just prompt injection to cover the entire system.

## From Theory to Reality: A Real-World Threat

Let's make this concrete. The guide applies MAESTRO to a real-world scenario: an RPA (Robotic Process Automation) agent designed to approve employee expense reports.

Using a traditional approach, you might look for vulnerabilities like privilege compromise. But MAESTRO pushes for a deeper analysis.

Consider this threat, identified at the Data Operations (Layer 2):

**Threat: Semantic Drift in Expense Policy Embeddings**

**The Scenario**: The RPA agent uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to check expense claims against company policy. This policy is stored as embeddings in a vector database. The company then updates its policy—for example, to no longer allow expenses for alcoholic beverages.

**The Vulnerability**: If the vector database isn't updated, the agent's "knowledge" of the policy becomes outdated. It continues to retrieve the old policy and approve claims that include alcohol, directly violating the new rules.

**Why It's Different**: This isn't a classic bug. The code is working as intended. The vulnerability lies in the gap between the real-world policy and the agent's understanding of it. It's a failure of data integrity that becomes a security threat.

MAESTRO helps identify dozens of these subtle, agentic-specific threats—from an agent getting stuck in a costly loop on a blockchain to a malicious user exploiting a chain of trusted agents to bypass authorization.

## The Path Forward

The era of multi-agent systems is here, and it demands a new level of security diligence. We can no longer treat our AI systems as black boxes or simple input-output machines. We must see them as complex, interconnected ecosystems with novel vulnerabilities.

The OWASP Multi-Agentic System Threat Modelling Guide, and the MAESTRO framework within it, provides the language and structure we need to begin this critical work. For anyone building, deploying, or managing these systems, the message is clear: it's time to start modeling these new threats before they become the next headline.
